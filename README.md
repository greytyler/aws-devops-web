# AWS CI/CD Pipeline: Java Web App Deployment

# 🚀 AWS CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub → CodeBuild → CodeDeploy → EC2

![Architecture Diagram](./images/architecture-6.png)
<br>

## 📌 Project Overview
 This project demonstrates a full CI/CD pipeline on AWS, automating code deployments from source to production. It integrates GitHub for version control, CodeBuild for compiling and testing, and CodeDeploy for rolling out updates to EC2 instances within a VPC. 
 The goal is to gain practical experience with cloud-native CI/CD using real AWS tools. 
 While the pipeline operates behind the scenes, it significantly improves and automates the release process for the Java web application.




## 🛠️ Tech Stack
***GitHub*** – Store and version the code

***AWS CodePipeline*** – CI/CD Orchestration

***AWS CodeBuild*** – Compilation and Testing

***AWS CodeDeploy*** – Automated EC2 Deployment

***AWS EC2*** –  software development and deployment happens entirely on the cloud.
 - Key pairs, SSH connections, Git, Maven and Java.

***AWS S3*** – Stores build artifacts

***AWS CloudFormation*** – Infrastructure as Code

***AWS CodeArtifact*** – Stores Maven dependencies (secured with policy)

***Java (Corretto 8)*** – Application Language

***Apache Maven*** – Build Tool

###### 🧭 Architecture Flow

##### Source Stage

The Source stage in CodePipeline specifies the default branch to monitor for changes, ensuring the pipeline follows the correct code version. It also enables webhooks to automatically trigger the pipeline whenever new code is pushed to the linked GitHub repository.


##### Build Stage



Deploy Stage
